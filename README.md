### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ikeyurp/ikeyurp/master/src/Hi.gif" width="30px">

This is the place where I open-source stuff and break things :rofl:. I like experimenting with new technologies, building small projects, and occassionally joining hackathons✨.

#### I am a helping hand to anyone in IT related support.
I made this project just for fun, it allows you to create nice and simple GitHub Readme files that you can copy/paste and use in your profile.
